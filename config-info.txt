** SAMBA (FILESERVER)
- (following https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Setting_up_Samba_as_a_Domain_Member)
- edit /etc/systemd/resolved.conf: DNS=192.168.4.3 Domains=adds.com
- reboot and check to make sure that /etc/resolv.conf has changed
	- note that the nameserver will be 172.0.0.53; DNS will still work
	- it should say "search adds.com" at the bottom of the file
- check DNS resolution and reverse lookup using dog
- check SRV resolution using nslookup (see guide above)
- edit /etc/samba/smb.conf:
	- workgroup = ADDS
	- realm = ADDS.COM
	- server role = member server
- edit /etc/samba/smb.conf to use rid idmap backend (see here -> https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Idmap_config_rid)
- sudo smbcontrol all reload-config
- add this line to /etc/hosts (this information is given to the AD DC to add to the DNS config):
	192.168.4.4 samba.adds.com ubuntuwebserver
- sudo net ads join -U administrator
- append "winbind" to the "passwd" and "group" databases in /etc/nsswitch.conf (i.e., add them after "files systemd")
- sudo apt install winbind (why this is not auto-installed as a dependency of samba, i have no idea...)
- enable (sudo systemctl enable --now [service name]) the following services:
	- smbd
	- nmbd (possibly unnecessary... could disable later)
	- winbind
- sudo apt install libnss-winbind (so we can getent users and groups on the DC)
- add these to smb.conf and reload the samba config
	winbind enum users = yes
	winbind enum groups = yes	

- set up fileserver according to https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Setting_up_a_Share_Using_Windows_ACLs:
	- add the following lines to smb.conf under the share definitions section (and reload-config):
		vfs objects = acl_xattr
		map acl inherit = yes
	- sudo mkdir -p /srv/samba/Share (make share directory)
	- add the following to smb.conf under the share definitions section (and reload-config):
		[Share]
			path = /srv/samba/Share/
			read only = no
	- from the web server, change the group owner of the Share directory from root to one of the domain groups
	- (e.g., "ADDS\Domain Admins"), so that files can be edited from windows
	- follow instructions in the link above to view and/or modify ACLs and permissions on the shared folder
	- test to make sure it works (create and modify files across connected devices)

- 50 GB disk space
- 4096 MB (4 GB) RAM
- 4 CPU cores
- ip address: 192.168.4.3

- domain name: adds.com
- DSRM password: admin123!

** Group policies (domain: adds.com):
- Password Complexity:
	- Password must meet complexity requirements
	- Minimum password length: 8 characters

** DNS
- ipv4 (A) RR: adds.com -> 192.168.4.3
- ipv4 (A) RR: website.com -> 192.168.4.4 (ubuntu server) and corresponding PTR record
- PTR record for 3.4.168.192.in-addr.arpa -> adds.com
- no ipv6 records yet
- configure dns forwarder: dns manager -> properties (on dns server) -> forwarders
	- you need to set this to give hosts access to the wider internet
	- i set this to 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1 (cloudflare's public dns server)

** DHCP
- scope (hosts): 192.168.4.1 - 192.168.4.254
